This app displays my learning on:
1. how to do _async_ and _await_ function on JavaScript;
2. how to use Event Listener;
3. how to access webcam;
4. how to integrate optical character recognition or OCR; and
5. how to integrate text to speech function


I use [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js#tesseractjs), an open source javascript library, for this project.
